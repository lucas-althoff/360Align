# Align360
An Open Dataset and Software for Investigating QoE and Head Motion in 360◦ Videos with Alignment Edits. Employing the Double Stimulus method, 45 participants evaluated each of the 30 original-processed video pairs, generating a dataset of 5400 Comfort and Sense of Presence ratings. Concurrently, Head Motion (HM) was recorded from the Meta Quest 2 device during video consumption.

## Dataset

- Test Video Sequences: 30 test video pairs consisting of the original (30s long) followed by the processed video (30s long) can be found at [Videos](https://osf.io/yaqhb/) (14.6 GB).
- QoE and HM Data: The Comfort and Sense of Presence ratings, the Cybersickness Questionnaire responses, and the complete HM data for each trial [Data](https://osf.io/khcu2/) (200 MB).

## Software

- Gathering tool: The web application used for performing the experiment procedure [Mono360](https://osf.io/x8fsq/) (1.6 GB).
- Analysis scripts: Scripts for analyzing HM data and running statistical analysis [Analysis Scripts](https://osf.io/y8qag/).
